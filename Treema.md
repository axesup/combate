Treema is an integral part of the interface in CodeCombat. It provides a flexible and universal system for viewing and editing complex and specified JSON data. It's used in particular throughout the editors, but can also be used for any sort of data work. For all but the most simple tables, use Treema wherever possible.

See the [Treema page](http://codecombat.github.io/treema/) for more info.

### Customizing Treema

treema-ext.coffee creates and installs Treema nodes that are accessible for any Treemas made throughout the site. Search files for "extends TreemaNode" to find other examples of TreemaNodes being used for certain purposes. These alone are what customize Treema to handle formats specific to CodeCombat.
