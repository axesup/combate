# Scribes

Programming and code aren't the only languages we use at CodeCombat —— the written word makes our app easy to understand, fun to play, and a joy to contribute to. For these important tasks, we lean on our [Scribes](http://codecombat.com/contribute/scribe).

##What Scribes Can Work On
If you're ready to flex your writing skills, here are the places where we can use your help the most: 
 
1. Each level has a guide with some level-specific tips and tricks in it. We want to make sure these guides nudge folks along, but keep the game challenging. Take a look through the existing guides and see if they make sense, especially to someone who is learning to code. As we create new levels, we need to write new guides for them, too. ([Example](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pv7yvxomlfa5nre/Screenshot%202014-12-31%2011.07.03.png?dl=0))

We could also use some specific articles on particular programming languages and concepts, so that when a concept is used in a level, we can pull in that article into a tab in the Guide. (example)

Each player-accessible method and property has its own documentation, which often doesn't get enough love and isn't written beginner-friendlily. We'd love to have those level up. (example)

Each level, item, and hero has a short description associated with it. Too often we're too focused on just building these things to do a good job on the copywriting. We really need a pass over these to add great descriptions to things. (example level, example item, example hero and editor)

General website / community / contribute copy improvements. (example)

Keeping our FAQ simple and easy to understand.

Our GitHub wiki desperately needs some help, too: content, organization, wording, etc.
