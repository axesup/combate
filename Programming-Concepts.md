#### Algorithms
Used in the later levels when covering a 'classical' algorithm problem. Fizzbuzz, solving a maze, and array sorting would fall under this concept.
#### Advanced Strings
This concept comes into play when performing actions on strings. For example: getting a string length, adding strings, splicing strings.
#### Arguments
When passing a value into a function, this concept is employed. `this.moveRight(2)`, `this.cleave(enemy)`, etc.
#### Arithmetic
Any sort of addition/subtraction/multiplication/division of numbers. `nextStep = self.pos.x + 1`, `midX = (a.x + b.x) / 2`.
#### Arrays
If the level includes arrays in any way. `var enemies = this.findEnemies()`, `var friendNames = ['Molly', 'Bolly', 'Holly']`.
#### Basic Syntax
All levels teach basic syntax. What do you think this is? Block-based programming?
#### Boolean Logic
If the level specifically goes into True/False instead of using Thruthy/Falsey behaviors of elements. Not: `if enemy:`.
#### Break Statements
Include this if the level covers breaking out of a loop prematurely.
#### Classes
If the player is required to create their own classes inside of CodeCombat.
#### Continue Statements
This is for levels that cover continue.
#### For Loops
If the level focuses on using for-loops. Note, some late desert levels use while-loops with a manual index, so be sure to place your level appropriately.
#### Functions
When the user creates their own functions in a level. (See: Late Mountain levels.)
#### Graphics
If the user is drawing in some way. (See: Flowers.)
#### If Statements
Include when the level uses if-statements. (Pretty much all levels after early forest.)
#### Input Handling
Currently this covers flag-input.
#### Math Operations
Arithmetic covers +/-/*//, but, Math operations is for the Math library. `Math.pow(,)`, `Math.sin()`, `Math.acos()`.
#### Object Literals
If the user creates 
#### Parameters
Include this if the user creates functions which take an argument. `function foo(_bar)`.
#### Strings
Simple string variables. If a level has `"this is a string"`, it probably needs this concept.
#### Variables
Declaring any variables. So, that's probably a lot of levels.
#### While Loops
This covers both simple main-loops as well as more complex optimization loops. If it says `while`, it is a while-loop.
#### Vectors
Includes all levels which make use of Vector math. Adding, subtracting, dot products, etc.
#### Recursion
If a player is responsible for creating a self-referencing function.
