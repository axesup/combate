## Static content
The website's i18n is done by editing locale files in `app/locale`.
If you canÂ´t figure out how it is done, just check [the procedure](http://us3.campaign-archive1.com/?u=c86c5e56e46659873417a8f1c&id=f89f8903f2).

## Dynamic content

To i18n the content of the game itself, just go to http://codecombat.com/i18n, choose your language, and start translating.
