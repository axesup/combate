### Meaning of i18n
Internationalization (sometimes shortened to "I18N, meaning "I - eighteen letters - N") is the process of planning and implementing products and services so that they can easily be adapted to specific local languages and cultures, a process called localization (sometimes shortened to "l10n", meaning "l - ten letters - n"); this last is the process of adapting a product or service to a particular language, culture, and desired local "look-and-feel".

### Translating:
#### The static content
The website's i18n is done by editing locale files in [app/locale](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/tree/master/app/locale).
If you can´t figure out how it is done, just follow this simple procedure:

1. Fork the [CodeCombat repository](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat).
1. Look at [app/locale/locale.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/locale/locale.coffee) to find the language code you want to translate into, like ["fr"](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/locale/locale.coffee#L23).
1. Open the file in app/locale, like ["fr.coffee"](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/locale/fr.coffee).
1. Click edit, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

#####Editing en.coffee

There is only one difference that you need to be aware of when editing en.coffee.  If you edit a line, you will have to append it with `{change}` so that the translation manager realises that you have made a change and can alert the diplomats so that they can transfer the change to other languages.

#### The dynamic content

To i18n the content of the game itself, just go to [i18n](http://codecombat.com/i18n), choose your language, and start translating.
