Need to discuss this before it can be specified. These are the main points I'd like to touch on:

* Issues tracked in Github
* Discussions through Discourse, HipChat and Google Hangout/Skype
* Changes through forking and pull requests
* Github branching gitflow style
* Encourage people to choose a turf and work on it, like focus on server, or the play view, or testing, or whatever. There should be some system for vetting new ideas, though.
