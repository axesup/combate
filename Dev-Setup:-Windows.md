Download the latest version [here (v3.7)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/138899/GitHub%20Wikis/coco-dev-win-setup-3.7.zip) and/or follow the instructions from [this step-by-step guide](#Setup-on-Windows:-a-step-by-step-guide).  The complete process is fully automated for all supported Windows versions.

We support the following, and only the following versions:
* Windows Vista
* Windows 7
* Windows 8.0 - Problems found
* Windows 8.1


**Note**: if your brunch isn't compiling sass properly, try removing the bless-brunch entry from package.json and deleting the bless-brunch folder from node_modules, then getting sass-brunch 1.7.0 with `npm install --save-dev sass-brunch@1.7.0`

Other versions, newer then _Windows XP_, and not listed above, might work, but we don't guarantee that they will.
