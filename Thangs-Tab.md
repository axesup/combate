The Thangs Tab gives you a general overview of the layout of the level and the thangs available to you, and is the main way you'll add and move around thangs.

### Adding a Thang

1. Scroll through the thangs available on the right.
1. Left click one
1. Hover your mouse over the central canvas area. The Thang should appear under your mouse, though it may take a moment for it to load.
1. Left click where you would like to place the Thang.

### Selecting a Thang

You can either

* Left click on the Thang in the central canvas area, or
* Left click on the Thang in the list on the left. Use the filters above the list to see only certain categories of thangs at a time.

### Configuring a Thang

Thangs behave and interact with other Thangs based on the Components they have and the configurations of those Components. To configure a Thang, double click it either in the list on the left or the canvas area in the middle.

### Moving a Thang

You can either

* Left click on the Thang and drag it, or
* Configure the Thang and edit its Physical component configuration directly.

### Deleting a Thang

Select a thang and press 'delete' on your keyboard to remove it. You can often remove several thangs by selecting one on the list on the left and then repeatedly pressing delete.

### Cloning a Thang

Holding the 'alt' key, left click on the thang in the central area. You will then have a copy of the Thang you have selected with the same Components and configurations as the original. This is useful if you want to make a gaggle of thangs all with the same behavior which isn't the default behavior for that thang.
