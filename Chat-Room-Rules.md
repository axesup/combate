#Rules
Just like any chat room there are a few ground rules to make the CodeCombat chat room a safe and kind environment.  So here  is a few of those rules:

1. Any form of harassment is prohibited.

2. Sexual messages, or inappropriate messages in general are not allowed as well.

3. Though the Slack channel / HipChat room is fun, it is also a professional place where we discuss things, not a crazy chat room.  If you ever want to do that go to our [off-topic room] (https://www.hipchat.com/gaXOD7lQ8), but please don't get out of hand.

4. Spamming is not allowed, but talking a lot is different.
