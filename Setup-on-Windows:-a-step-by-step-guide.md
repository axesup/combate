#### WARNING
_The automatic setup for windows is still in development. The first beta released is planned really soon. If you want the latest development news on this setup, ask **Glen DC** on the [CodeCombat chatroom](http://www.hipchat.com/g3plnOKqa).for more information. **Don't try to follow this guide yet!**_

_For now it's best to use [the manual installation guide](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Windows-Development-Environment-Setup-Guide) if you want to develop on CodeCombat on the Windows platform._

#### Introduction
The manual installation of the CodeCombat development environment on Windows was tricky, and a lot of users had troubles of this. Therefore we decided to develop a fully automatic setup for Windows, to avoid users getting frustrated, and possibly give up, before they ever started on the real development. That's in a nullshet the short background of why this setup exists in the first place.

Please note that this setup is development and maintained by only one person. This means that there is a high risk of potential bugs. These can and should be reported like any other issue on [the official CodeCombat issue list](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues?labels=enhancement&state=open). Because of this solo development process there is probably quite some room for optimisations and improvements possible, to make it work faster, safer and better. Feel free to discuss proposels to improve it, with **Glen DC** on the [CodeCombat chatroom](http://www.hipchat.com/g3plnOKqa).

####How to use this installation
First of all you'll have to extract the downloaded archived setup. You can find the download [here](#download). Once you've done this, you can just go inside the directory and open the setup.bat file. Don't be scared by this old-school approach, trust me, it's really easy to use!

The only requirements for this setup are a keyboard and a working brain.

The entire installation is command-line based to keep the installation as lightweight and clean as possible. It also allows us to have a minimum amount of depandancies. The installation is **question-based**. This means that there will be several questions asked. Some are simple Yes or No questions where you respectively answer with _Y_ or _N_. Other questions are more complex. These type of questions usually ask you to enter a full path. Here follow **some important rules when entering a path as the answer of a question**:
* A path should be entered as a full path, that means starting with the Drive Letter and going up from there on. (e.g. c:\directory)
* Use the backslash ( \\ ) character to seperate directory levels.
* Please avoid whitespace characters in any part of your full path. If you really really insist on having a space character in your path, be sure to surround the entire path with the quote ( " ) character.
* Make sure to double check your entered before pressing enter, entering a wrong path can lead to a failed setup and even to the modification and/or delations of wrong directories.

The entire setup is designed to be as user friendly and automatic as possible. In fact this guide shouldn't be needed at all. It is only here to fill in, where the setup failed in usability and to make the installation of the environment on Windows even easier, than it already is.
